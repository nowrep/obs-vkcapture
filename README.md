# OBS Linux Vulkan/OpenGL game capture

OBS plugin for Vulkan/OpenGL game capture on Linux.

AUR: [obs-vkcapture-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/obs-vkcapture-git/)

**Flatpak:**
* OBS plugin: [com.obsproject.Studio.Plugin.OBSVkCapture](https://github.com/flathub/com.obsproject.Studio.Plugin.OBSVkCapture)
* Capture tools: [org.freedesktop.Platform.VulkanLayer.OBSVkCapture](https://github.com/flathub/org.freedesktop.Platform.VulkanLayer.OBSVkCapture)

## About Flatpak
If you use Flatpak OBS, you need to install Flatpak *OBS plugin*.  
If you want to capture games that are also installed as a Flatpak, you need to install Flatpak *Capture tools* to be able to capture them.

For capturing games outside Flatpak runtime, you need native build regardless of if you are using Flatpak OBS or not.

## Dependencies

* cmake
* libobs
* libvulkan
* libgl
* libegl
* libX11 (optional)
* libxcb (optional)
* libwayland-client (optional)
* wayland-scanner (optional)

## Building

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
    make && make install

## Usage

1. Add `Game Capture` to your OBS scene.
2. Start the game with capture enabled `obs-gamecapture %command%`.
    - To start a Flatpak game with this argument, you can use this template: `flatpak run -command=/usr/lib/extensions/vulkan/OBSVkCapture/bin/obs-gamecapture foo.bar.Bar /app/bin/bar`
3. (Recommended) Start the game with only Vulkan capture enabled `env OBS_VKCAPTURE=1 %command%`.
    - In the Flatpak environment, you can add this environment variable like such: `flatpak override --user foo.bar.Bar --env=OBS_VKCAPTURE=1`

## Troubleshooting

**NVIDIA**

Driver version >= 515.43.04 and `nvidia-drm.modeset=1` kernel parameter are required. In Wayland session make sure OBS is running on Wayland and not XWayland.
